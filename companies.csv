With Appallicious' Skipitt platform, a variety of mobile apps can be created using open data feeds from local, state and federal government. Appallicious created the San Francisco's Rec & Park app, featured by the U.S. Department of Energy, and named one of the 7 open data apps every city should have by Mashable.

The app lets users find parks, playgrounds, museums, recreation centers, picnic tables, and restrooms, all provided with descriptions and displayed on a GPS enabled map. Searching through the simple and easy to use interface brings efficiency, transparency, and exposure to the services and facilities maintained by the City and County of SF.

Named as a 2013 AlwaysOn Global 250 ""Ones to Watch""� company for the second year in a row, Appallicious also developed Neighborhood Score, which was launched by San Francisco Mayor Ed Lee. Neighborhood Score uses data sets to allow residents to see how their neighborhoods rank in public safety, quality of schools, crime rates, air quality, and more.",The Appallicious Mobile Commerce Platform is the leading technology for government and business to go mobile.,"Appallicious supports developing open data policies all over the country.

After her death, Yo was inspired to create an application that would provide San Francisco residents with more information about their neighborhoods and the places they live. Neighborhood Score lets you see a score for any block in San Francisco.

NuCivic solutions are based on distributions (specialized configurations), of the Drupal CMS that runs many of the worldâ€™s most complex civic websites.  Thus, NuCivic incoporates technical innovation from more than 20,000 engineers that have contributed code to Drupal. 
 
â€¨NuCivic solutions are delivered as â€œOpenSaaSâ€-- turnkey hosted and supported software-as-a-service (SaaS), but still truly open-source, such that a customer can export their solution and redeploy it in their own environment at any time.
 
Our first NuCivic product is â€œNuData DKAN,â€ based on our DKAN distribution of Drupal.  DKAN provides a full suite of open data cataloging, publishing and visualization features, and is feature and API-compatible with CKAN, the popular Python-based software widely deployed by many national governments.  

Dubbed by The Atlantic Cities as one of â€œ12 Fresh Ideas for Local Government,â€ during the Knight News Challenge for Open Government, DKANâ€™s early adopters include Open Puerto Rico, British Columbia, the Revenue Watch Institute, and the City of Cologne.","NuCivic is a suite of open source products powered by Nuams that help governments and non-profit organizations easily and affordably host and manage open data, app store and hackathon platforms.","All NuCivic products are open source, which means they are free for anyone to download, install and begin using themselves.

These enterprise tools inhibit city administrators, department heads, elected officials, and citizens from directly accessing important budget and financial data. OpenGov.com solves this pain point by offering governments a flexible, powerful software-as-a-service platform.

OpenGov.com builds a web-based platform for state and local government financial data. The OpenGov Platform provides instant access to the budget and visualizes current and historic revenue and expenses‚Äîfrom multi-year trends to object-level details. Government officials and citizens use the platform to understand, analyze, and share the financial information.

Comprised of top technologists, Silicon Valley entrepreneurs, and government finance experts, OpenGov.com brings affordable and user-friendly financial applications to governments of all sizes. The software-as-a-service platform improves data access, financial decision-making, and builds trust with citizens.","OpenGov enables officials and citizens to access government financial data so they can chart trends, pull data points, run reports, and see revenue and expenditures to improve trust and dialogue between cities and citizens.","OpenGov's web-based software improves financial decision-making, promotes understanding, and builds trust within communities. Making the data more transparent and easier to access creates enormous benefits for both the citizen and the government. OpenGov's software improves governance through creating information-based decisions and builds engaged communities through creating trust with citizens.","OpenGov raised approximately $7 million in venture funding since its founding, having received the first $3 million in July 2012. Those contributing to the Series A round were Formation 8, FF Angel, Founders Collective and prominent angels. Thrive Capital and Valiant Capital led the $4 million July 2013 bridge note along with participation from existing investor Formation 8.

/Science-Exchange,Science Exchange,http://scienceexchange.com,"Palo Alto, CA",2011,,Private,,Online Marketplace,Scientific Research,User fees for web or mobile access,"Science Exchange is an online platform seeking to provide easy access to the global network of scientific resources and expertise. The platform functions as a marketplace helping research scientists find the expertise and services they need at other university labs, core facilities, and contract research organizations. The objective is to help improve the pace of scientific research by improving the efficiency by which researchers can search for, compare and order scientific services on an open marketplace platform.

For service providers, Science Exchange aims to increase utilization and quality recognition within an open marketplace. Service providers are government funded core facilities and university labs, which have difficulty in promoting services for external use, and tracking impact of services. Science Exchange helps researchers find the facility's services in a centralized platform, and increase utilization of labs that are running below capacity. The platform also allows for tracking of all work performed, and publications resulting from work performed on the site with collaborates - making management and reporting of service labs easier.

Overall, the goal of Science Exchange is to help scientists access the resources and expertise at university based institutions, that they otherwise could not find, afford, or access.","Science Exchange's goal is to make it easier for researchers to access the world's scientific expertise, advancing open science initiatives to change the pace of scientific research.","Primarily, Science Exchange tracks the number of research collaborations formed through utilization of the online marketplace. Each order on Science Exchange is essentially a contract formed between two research scientists. This helps the researcher save grant funding as they can then access low-cost expertise at another lab, without having to order new equipment. This also helps the service labs run at capacity, as they are federally funded and required to operate at capacity. We also track research publications resulting from the collaborations on our platform, as the platform expands their scope by helping engage in larger studies otherwise not possible.","Science Exchange is a venture backed company, but one with a strong social mission open science access.

We were started as a part of the Y Combinator incubator program, and have received funding from some of the top VC firms including Andreessen Horowitz, O'Reilly AlphaTech Ventures, and Union Square Ventures. We strategically choose investment from firms like OATV, as they match our open access mission.

We actively collaborate, participate, and support the open science framework. We've partnered with eagle-i to improve access to government-funded resources in online directories. We've established the Reproducibility Initiative to leverage our online network of service providers to validate public studies, and publish the reproduced results in open access journals. We have received support from nonprofits such as the Arnold Foundation to pursue these goals.",questionnaire,"dataset.url,dataset.name
