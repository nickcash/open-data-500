<p class="warning"><strong>How to use this page:</strong> Click on a square to expand it and read the brief company description. Click on a company's name to view more information and for a space to comment. </p>
<p class="warning"><strong>Please Note:</strong> We expect to that this list may change as we learn more about how each company operates – that’s part of our open process. Many of these companies have not yet responded to our survey, so information about them may change as we receive more input from them and from others.</p>
