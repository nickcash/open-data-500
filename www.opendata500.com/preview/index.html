<h3>Description:</h3>
<p>Azavea is an award-winning geospatial software company based in Philadelphia.  The firm was organized to create advanced web and mobile applications for geospatial data visualization and analysis.  Azavea is a certified B Corporation, a for-profit corporation with a social mission.  Our mission is to apply geospatial data and software to create more sustainable, vital, and livable communities while advancing the state-of-the-art through research.  

Geospatial data has become a vital part of the operations of local, state, and federal government, driving everything from emergency response to land conservation.  Azavea applies user interface (UI) design and cloud computing to create web applications that can process big geospatial data sets very rapidly.  We also share much of our work by releasing it under open source licenses so that others can re-use it.  

In addition to working with open geospatial datasets from a variety of federal and local sources, Azavea is dedicated to making that data available to others for transformation into creative new applications.  Azavea's vision is a world in which geospatial analysis is part of a broad foundation upon which government, private, and nonprofit organizations operate for the common good by exchanging information, enhancing knowledge, and fostering collaboration.</p>
<h3>Social Impact:</h3>
<p>First, we focus on projects that have positive civic and social impact.  Second, Azavea shares its commercial success through pro bono work, mentoring programs, organizing civic hackathons, and by donating a portion of its profits to charitable organizations.  Third, many of our software projects are released under open source licenses.</p>
<h3>Financial Info:</h3>
<p>Azavea is a bootstrap company that does not have any external investors.  The firm has grown by reinvesting its profits in growth, product development, and research projects that combine user interface design with geospatial analysis and apply high performance computing techniques to geographic data processing.  While the firm initially grew in Philadelphia, for the past eight years, it has diversified to serve both national and international customers.</p>

As a result, we are able to provide data with a whole new level of detail, faster, and at a much better value. Our expertise is that we process and store all XBRL filings in a uniquely structured, cloud based data universe; we use advanced computing techniques to identify and correct errors (close to half a million corrections made so far), and increase comparability between companies; and we make data available to you within minutes after a filing leaves the CFOs hands.</p>

<h3>Description:</h3>
<p>The Construction Monitor's vision is to compile and database every building permit (valuation over 10k) issued throughout the United States every week. Currently we have reached that goal in the Western United States and Texas. At the start of 2012 we launched a campaign to have the Eastern United States covered by the end of 2014. The company was founded in 1989. Over the years we have developed a proprietary system to collect and database building permits in "real time". The data is used by the construction industry for leads to find new work and the financial industry to forecast economic trends. There are many other industries (both public and private) that use building permit data in many different ways.</p>
<h3>Social Impact:</h3>
<p>Building permit information is a valuable resource for creating a more competitive environment in the construction industry just through knowledge of what's happening. Our permit data is more detailed and timely than the data provided by the Census Bureau. It contains all kinds of data for all kinds of construction. The detailed data is used by regulatory agencies for monitoring compliance with licensing, air quality, waste management, etc. School districts use the data for planning new schools. Metro development agencies use it for forecasting  growth and transportation needs. Utilities use it to insure infrastructure will be in place.</p>
<h3>Financial Info:</h3>
<p>The company is owned by Dave Mineer Sr and son David Mineer Jr. At this time we have 23 employees and about 100 independent contractors throughout the world. Our gross revenues grew to little over $2,000,000 in 2008 and stayed there during the recession for 4 years. This year with the construction industry rebounding our goal is to reach $3,000,000 by the end of the year. We are currently self funded.</p>

<h3>Description:</h3>
<p>Consumer Reports was founded in 1936 when advertising first flooded the mass media. Consumers lacked a reliable source of information they could depend on to help them distinguish hype from fact and good products from bad ones. Since then Consumer Reports has filled that vacuum with a broad range of consumer information. To maintain its independence and impartiality, Consumer Reports accepts no outside advertising and no free samples and employs several hundred mystery shoppers and technical experts to buy and test the products it evaluates.

Consumer Reports, is one of the top-circulation magazines in the country, and ConsumerReports.org, has the most subscribers of any website of its kind, in addition to two newsletters, Consumer Reports on Health and Consumer Reports Money Adviser. They have combined subscriptions of more than 8 million. All of Consumer Reports' work is informed by the more than 1 million readers who respond to our Annual Questionnaire, among the largest and most comprehensive consumer studies in the world. In 2008, Consumer Reports also launched several initiatives, including the Consumer Reports Health Ratings Center, which serve to educate and empower consumers to make more informed health-care decisions and to help change the market.</p>

<h3>Description:</h3>
<p>Energy Points uses a unifying metric, big data and comprehensive analytics to manage enterprise energy resources, such as electricity, fuels, water, and materials. The Company "software-as-a-service (SaaS)" platform combines advanced analytics with complex resource scarcity data to translate all resources into a unifying metric enabling a direct, one-to-one comparison of domains such as electricity, water, waste and fuel.

The Energy Resource Management (ERM) industry is growing rapidly, similar to Customer Relationship Management a few decades ago. However, the ERM Industry has been struggling to find a simple and accurate, unifying solution that enables operational management and optimization of energy resources (water, electricity, fuel, waste etc.) across enterprises.

Energy Points directly addresses how companies can maximize resource efficiency with immediate financial return enhancing operational excellence, sustainability and branding.</p>
<h3>Social Impact:</h3>
<p>We engage and continue to work with faculty and students at colleges and universities to teach our quantitatively rigorous approach to resource sustainability. We also work on research projects related to energy and material efficiency meant to benefit the common understanding of sustainability and environmental performance.</p>
<h3>Financial Info:</h3>
<p>We allow organizations to optimize their financial and environmental performance. Our model is entirely business-to-business. We sell two products: a portal designed for organizations that consume multiple resources (electricity, water, etc.) typically in a large portfolio of assets. Our portal allows customers to analyze their portfolio, identify outliers, compare to benchmarks of environmental and financial performance as well as select and track projects. The other product is a software development kit (SDK) that serves as a calculation engine for companies that have their own portal.  We don't disclose revenue or funding figures.</p>

<h3>Description:</h3>
<p>Fastcase's mission is to democratize the law and to make legal research smarter.  America is a beacon to the world, a shining example of the rule of law -- yet access to our law is tightly controlled by a publishing duopoly.  Fastcase has created new ways to access the law, with smarter legal research tools and free apps for iOS and Android devices.  Fastcase also maintains the Public Library of Law, a free law library for nonlawyers.

Fastcase partners with 24 state bar associations to provide free legal research for their members, and today serve more than 600,000 subscribers.  According to the 2013 ABA Tech Survey, Fastcase is by far the most popular legal app in America.  Fastcase is based in Washington, D.C.</p>
<h3>Social Impact:</h3>
<p>We measure our impact by the number of people who are able to use our legal research tools to access the law, and with 600,000 subscribers and about 200,000 free mobile users, usage is very high.</p>
<h3>Financial Info:</h3>
<p>Fastcase is a private company, so we don't publicly disclose our financials.  But the company has been growing and profitable since 2005.  We raised a modest round of outside financing in 2003, but have scaled the business based on revenues.

Operationally, we are harvesting public law from thousands of websites every day, and keying large volumes of books.  It would be nice if courts and legislatures released their work in structured or consistent data, but they don't, so a lot of our work is collecting and structuring public law in a consistent format.</p>

<h3>Description:</h3>
<p>Lawdragon is a legal news website with an annual magazine that provides coverage of high-profile legal matters and the attorneys handling them. Our best-known editorial feature is the "Lawdragon 500 Leading Lawyers," our annual lawyers-of-the-year guide that we believe is the most elite distinction in the profession. We also report on international justice developments and have done in-depth features on human rights cases in South Africa, the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda.

Our site also offers a free database of lawyers that lets companies and individuals search for and fill out evaluations of legal professionals, and provides a platform for lawyers to promote their services. 

This fall, we are building a new site on legal education that will provide regular editorial coverage of law schools and a school-search function for prospective students that we will market as an alternative to the U.S. News & World Report rankings. This will also provide evaluations of schools and professors.</p>
<h3>Social Impact:</h3>
<p>Lawdragon is passionate about sharing high-quality news and information about legal professionals and organizations to create qualitative search results as an alternative to the dominant pay-driven model. We strive to enhance the legal profession and access to justice by providing free information on lawyers and law schools.</p>
<h3>Financial Info:</h3>
<p>Lawdragon generates revenue from a multi-faceted business model which includes advertising sales, online profile placements and other services which support the legal community.  Much of this revenue is renewable annually.</p>

<h3>Description:</h3>
<p>LegiNation, Inc. was founded with the goal of making state level legislation more readily available to the professionals who need it, and even more importantly to the public at large. We are building products and websites to spark a renaissance in American politics, leveraging the internet to create the dialog so desperately needed amongst our elected officials, legislative professionals, and everyday citizens.

BillTrack50 is available for everyone to research state and federal legislation and legislators any time, for free. We believe there are lots of smart people with great ideas about the challenges facing the United States today. Our goal is to help them become informed about what their government is doing, and to connect with their representatives to offer their insights and knowledge where and when they are needed. Together we can build a country that works for everyone. Really, it's not hopeless, we can do it!

BillTrack50 also provides simple, elegant tools for tracking and sharing bills, as a subscription service. These tools are appropriate for professionals and organizations who need to keep on top of legislative developments, and keep others (and /or the public) informed about bills as they progress through the process.</p>
<h3>Social Impact:</h3>
<p>In addition to having paying customers like Apple and BIPAC, we have had over 8,000 individuals registered to use our site and look up legislation about issues that matter to them.  We passed 1,000,000 bills read on our site in late 2013, which we are very proud of.  We feel that kind of engagement shows people are interested in what their government is up to.</p>

<h3>Description:</h3>
<p>MapBox is an open source platform for designing and publishing maps and geo data for both mobile and on the web. On MapBox.com you can sign up and create a map within minutes, then simply embed the map via copy / paste on the web or build complex applications for web or mobile with it. Power anything from the contact page on a small blog to data visualizations of billions of datapoints to base maps for massive traffic on large scale sites. We started MapBox to make it easy for anyone to design and publish a beautiful custom map. Our platform gives developers the power to make maps that embody their product and brand. MapBox helps you find bars on foursquare, search for hotels on Hipmunk, and organize notes in Evernote. With our global, autoscaling infrastructure and cross-device compatibility, integrating our maps into your apps is easy even if you have millions of users. Over the last 3 years our team of dedicated cartographers, data analysts, and software engineers has built our entire stack using open source software and open data.</p>
<h3>Social Impact:</h3>
<p>At MapBox we believe the future is open. This belief inspires our actions and contributions to several open source projects, like Mapnik and OpenStreetMap, a global, collaborative effort to create a free and universal map of the world. Every day, thousands of volunteers improve OpenStreetMap, fixing mistakes and adding new data.</p>
<h3>Financial Info:</h3>
<p>MapBox is growing fast. We have 2,000+ paid subscribers of our hosting service, and tens of thousands of free users using and experimenting with MapBox. A grant from the Knight Foundation allowed us to improve tools to edit OpenStreetMap, bringing in a wave of new contributors and improving this open map data that we - and many others - use in our basemap. Besides that, we have been fully bootstrapped.</p>

<p>Ontodia is an urban informatics startup focused on enabling actionable, hyperlocalized decisions.  It does this by converting raw data - taken from disparate sources - both public and private, extracting knowledge and insight.  From big data to small, actionable knowledge. It does this by using its "crowdknowing" technique to create Collective Knowledge Systems that leverage "semantics, statistics, algorithm and the crowd" to develop self-reinforcing Linked Data Networks that leverage the best of Humans and Machines to create a federated, curated Knowledge commons, one open data city at a time.</p>
<h3>Social Impact:</h3>
<p>Ontodia aims to democratize big data by helping create a federated, knowledge commons to enable governments, businesses and citizens to have data-driven discussions, conversations and decisions.  With this open knowledge, we hope to foster citizen engagement and increase trust in government as this same knowledge increases government transparency, accountability and reduce corruption.</p>

<h3>Description:</h3>
<p>OpportunitySpace is SalesForce.com and CoStar for government property. We collect and analyze data about public real property - land and buildings owned by governments. We enable administrators to understand their real estate portfolios from an enterprise view. We also help the private sector and community see what real estate the government controls and why. We believe that better access to this information will accelerate the pace of redevelopment and better uses of these assets. The goal is to create higher levels of transparency, engagement and collaboration around the utilization of public real estate and to drive smarter solutions that will result in vibrant, livable communities.</p>
<h3>Social Impact:</h3>
<p>OpportunitySpace reduces property carrying costs for government (vacants, brownfields, etc.), reduces size of government footprint in land area, increases tax revenue from land base, increases property values (revitalization/better land use), increases number of citizens engaged in planning/land use/redevelopment decisions (participation/engagement), and influences pace of development (e.g., number of properties disposed per month).</p>

<h3>Description:</h3>
<p>Personal (www.personal.com) is the award-winning, industry-leading digital vault and private networking service for individuals to securely manage their important data and files. Called a "life-management platform" by The Economist, Personal is built on a privacy- and security-by-design platform that empowers people with their own information.

Available at $29.99 per year, Personal also partners with companies (including financial and insurance companies, government, and educational institutions) and other organizations to provide vaults and data to their own customers and users. These co-branded vaults frequently come prepopulated with information that the partner holds about the individual that is instantly useful for 24/7 access from any device, auto form-filling (www.personal.com/fillit), and private, secure sharing. Each partner vault also has an array of apps to help users get the most from their data.  

Personal helps give people ownership and control over their data so they can get the most value from it all with the peace of mind that the information in their vault remains legally theirs, it can't be shared without their permission, they always know who has access to it, and they can stop access at any time. Users can also export and permanently delete their data. Personal is available on the web, iOS and Google Play.</p>
<h3>Social Impact:</h3>
<p>Personal's mission of empowering individuals with their own data is one that has major impacts for society, and the institutions (including government) that traditionally collect and control our data. Both government and companies are embracing this model, which is a significant sign of impact.</p>
<h3>Financial Info:</h3>
<p>To date, Personal has raised nearly $16 million in capital. Investors include Steve Case's Revolution Ventures, Grotech Ventures, Eric Semler of TCS Capital Management, Allen & Company, Ted Leonsis, former AOL CEO Jon Miller, among others. We generate revenue through paid subscriptions and partnering with companies and organizations to distribute co-branded Personal vaults to their customers and members. Partners include companies, non-profit associations, and educational institutions.</p>

<h3>Description:</h3>
<p>Science Exchange is an online platform seeking to provide easy access to the global network of scientific resources and expertise. The platform functions as a marketplace helping research scientists find the expertise and services they need at other university labs, core facilities, and contract research organizations. The objective is to help improve the pace of scientific research by improving the efficiency by which researchers can search for, compare and order scientific services on an open marketplace platform.

For service providers, Science Exchange aims to increase utilization and quality recognition within an open marketplace. Service providers are government funded core facilities and university labs, which have difficulty in promoting services for external use, and tracking impact of services. Science Exchange helps researchers find the facility's services in a centralized platform, and increase utilization of labs that are running below capacity. The platform also allows for tracking of all work performed, and publications resulting from work performed on the site with collaborates - making management and reporting of service labs easier.

Overall, the goal of Science Exchange is to help scientists access the resources and expertise at university based institutions, that they otherwise could not find, afford, or access.</p>
<h3>Social Impact:</h3>
<p>Primarily, Science Exchange tracks the number of research collaborations formed through utilization of the online marketplace. Each order on Science Exchange is essentially a contract formed between two research scientists. This helps the researcher save grant funding as they can then access low-cost expertise at another lab, without having to order new equipment. This also helps the service labs run at capacity, as they are federally funded and required to operate at capacity. We also track research publications resulting from the collaborations on our platform, as the platform expands their scope by helping engage in larger studies otherwise not possible.</p>
<h3>Financial Info:</h3>
<p>Science Exchange is a venture backed company, but one with a strong social mission open science access.

We were started as a part of the Y Combinator incubator program, and have received funding from some of the top VC firms including Andreessen Horowitz, O'Reilly AlphaTech Ventures, and Union Square Ventures. We strategically choose investment from firms like OATV, as they match our open access mission.

We actively collaborate, participate, and support the open science framework. We've partnered with eagle-i to improve access to government-funded resources in online directories. We've established the Reproducibility Initiative to leverage our online network of service providers to validate public studies, and publish the reproduced results in open access journals. We have received support from nonprofits such as the Arnold Foundation to pursue these goals.</p>

SeeClickFix could not be done without help. On top of the passionate, fast-growing team of entrepreneurs at SeeClickFix, it is really only made possible by the amazing volunteers, citizens, and members of governments large and small who are passionate about everything civic.</p>
<h3>Social Impact:</h3>

StreetCred's mission is to make police agencies more capable of safety and objectively enforcing and serving these warrants, gaining compliance with court ordered fines or fees in traffic cases, and leading to the arrest and removal from the community in case of more serious crime.</p>

<h3>Description:</h3>
<p>Science and technology policy makers, inventors, entrepreneurs, and those seeking to develop new markets benefit from more informed access to data about innovations and changes being brought about by the informationization of innovation.  Patents are a place where knowledge is power.  Spreading the word helps combat the chronic information asymmetry in the patentsphere.</p>

<h3>Financial Info:</h3>
<p>Way Better Patents is a self-funded, bootstrapped operation.  The combination of free access to patent data that used to cost over $100,000 as a starting point and the nature of internet start ups has enabled the principles to start a business with out own internal funding and to offer our services at prices that are disruptive to the patent and R&D information ecosystem.</p>
