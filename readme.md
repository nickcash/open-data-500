title: Understanding the Open Data 500 data
---
The [Open Data 500](http://www.opendata500.com/download/) is
"the first comprehensive study of U.S. companies using open government data to develop new products and services."
You may have read about it in.

[Fedscoop](http://fedscoop.com/open-data-500-intersection-open-data-economy/)
This is [data about open data](/open-data), so I naturally wanted it.
In the present article, I explain a bit about how the study is being conducted
and how the data are presented for download.

## Data collection methods
The Open Data 500 looks a bit scary and complicated when you read its website
and the articles about it, but the Open Data 500 is pretty much just a
straightforward questionnaire survey.

### The population of interest
The Open Data 500 Team is interested in companies that meet their
[eligibility criteria](http://www.opendata500.com/about/#about-eligibility),
which they describe as follows.

1. Be U.S.-based â€“ which can include international companies with a major presence in the U.S.
2. Earn revenue from its products and services. In addition to for-profit companies, nonprofits may qualify if they support themselves primarily through sales of products and services rather than philanthropy.
3. Use open government data as a critical resource for its business. (While most Open Data 500 companies will work with federal data, the study will also include some that use city or state data if their work can scale regionally or nationally)

The Open Data 500 site does not explain how they operationalize these criteria,
but I presume that it works as follows.

1. The questionnaire must indicate that a company has a major presence in the U.S.
2. The answer to "Which of the following are significant sources of revenue for your company?"
  must include something other than "Philanthropy".
3. The answer to "Which of the following are critical sources of data for your company?"
  must include "Federal Open Data", the questionnaire must indicate elsewhere that
  the company is using state or city data from a range of states or cities.

They are "[vetting](http://www.opendata500.com/about/#about-vetted)" companies,
but this sounds like just a conversation with the submitters to check that they
understood the questionnaire properly.

### Sampling strategy
The questionnaire results can be considered a convenience sample
[convenience sample](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accidental_sampling)
of companies that meet the Open Data 500 eligibility criteria.

The Open Data 500 Team distributed links to the questionnaire in
[these places](http://www.opendata500.com/about/#about-identify).

* Recommendations from government and non-governmental organizations studying this field.
* List of companies using datasets from Data.gov, the federal hub for government data
* Online Open Data Userbase created by Socrata
* Directory of open data companies developed by Deloitte
* Mass email to 3100 people in the GovLab network
* Mass email to 2200 people on contact list for OpenDataNow.com, website of Open Data 500 project director Joel Gurin
* Companies identified in research for upcoming book, Open Data Now
* Response to coverage of the Open Data 500 in Information Week and FedScoop
* Outreach through Twitter
* Outreach at "Data Transparency 2013" conference (September 2013, Washington, DC)
* Blog posts on TheGovLab.org and OpenDataNow.com

They term this sampling strategy "comprehensive call", and I think their use
of comprehensive call is why the Open Data 500 Team considers the Open Data 500
to be a comprehensive study.

### Case study
The Open Data 500 has released data in the
"[download]()" and
"[full list]()" sections.
These data are the straightforward questionnaire results (with one [quirk](#questionnaire-and-non-questionnaire-responses))
for the companies that met their eligibility criteria.
Thus, the Open Data 500 is a [case study](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_study)
of companies that meet the Open Data 500 eligibility criteria.

### Questionnaire and non-questionnaire responses
The questionnaire for the Open Data 500 is
[here](http://www.opendata500.com/submitCompany/).
Open Data 500 Team solicited responses to this questionnaire through
[comprehensive call](#sampling strategy), but they also looked for companies
that did not respond to the questionnaire; the Team effectively filled out
parts of this questionnaire for companies who did not respond.

## Just a questionnaire
According to the "[About](http://www.opendata500.com/about)" page on the
Open Data 500 site, the Open Data 500 "will identify, describe, and analyze
companies that use open government data in their businesses." As I understand
it, the analysis component of this has yet to occur.
This is the main thing that confused me about the study, so I'm going to
explain this part in a bit more depth in case anyone else was also confused.

The data collection for the Open Data 500 is just the questionnaire. Really.
For example, the Team isn't looking at companies products to see which open data
are used, and it isn't looking at annual reports to determine whether the
company does a lot of business in the United States. This is confusing because
the data releases do not look like the questionnaire, but I'm pretty sure that
the data come rather directly from the questionnaire.

### Preview of 50 companies
The Open Data 500 Team released an
"[in-depth view](http://www.opendata500.com/preview/)" of "50 of the first
to complete [the] survey". They also released a
"[full list](http://www.opendata500.com/candidates/)" of
"500 candidate companies". It took me a while to understand the difference
between these companies

### Pre-launch
At the moment, the Open Data 500 is in "pre-launch". This means that they have
begun to collect data but that they haven't done any sort of analysis on it.
(This part isn't explained on the website, but a member of the Open Data 500
Team explained this to me in person.)

## 500-ness
I'm still unsure as to what the "500" in the title means.

### Fortune 500?
Many people have suggested that the name is allusion to
[Fortune 500](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortune_500),
but I don't think that's it.
The Fortune 500 is list of "the top 500 U.S. closely held and public
corporations as ranked by their gross revenue after adjustments". That is,
it's the 500 biggest U.S. companies for a particular definition of "big".

The Fortune 500 and the Open Data 500 are both about U.S. companies, but
the similarities stop there; as explained on the
"[About](http://www.opendata500.com/about/#about-results)" page,
the Open Data 500 is explicitly not a ranking and not about company size.

### Number of responses?
The website says that the Open Data 500 is a list of 500 companies, so it
might be that the "500" refers to the number of companies responding to the
questionnaire, but this was a bit odd to me because they had chosen the name
before they first sent out the questionnaire.

One member of the Team told me that this was just a big number as a challenge
to themselves. Another told me that they expected, based on Joel Gurin's
network, that there were about 500 companies that would respond.
