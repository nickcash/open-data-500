The [Open Data 500](http://www.opendata500.com/download/) is
"the first comprehensive study of U.S. companies using open government data to develop new products and services."
You may have read about it in.

This is [data about open data](/open-data), so I naturally wanted it.

## Data collection methods
As I understand it, the data released on the website are quite close to simple
questionnaire results,
but there are some quirks in this of which you should be aware.

### Convenience sample
The Open Data 500 has released data for
"[download]()" and
as a "[full list]()".
These data are straightforward questionnaire results (with one [quirk](#questionnaire)).

They can be seen as a
[convenience sample](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accidental_sampling)
of companies that meet their
[eligibility criteria](http://www.opendata500.com/about/#about-eligibility),
which they describe as follows.

1. Be U.S.-based â€“ which can include international companies with a major presence in the U.S.
2. Earn revenue from its products and services. In addition to for-profit companies, nonprofits may qualify if they support themselves primarily through sales of products and services rather than philanthropy.
3. Use open government data as a critical resource for its business. (While most Open Data 500 companies will work with federal data, the study will also include some that use city or state data if their work can scale regionally or nationally)

The Open Data 500 site does not explain how they operationalize these criteria,
but I presume that it works as follows.

1. The questionnaire must indicate that a company has a major presence in the U.S.
2. The answer to "Which of the following are significant sources of revenue for your company?"
  must include something other than "Philanthropy".
3. The answer to "Which of the following are critical sources of data for your company?"
  must include "Federal Open Data", the questionnaire must indicate elsewhere that
  the company is using state or city data from a range of states or cities.

Remember, I'm pretty much entirely guessing at this.

They are [vetting](http://www.opendata500.com/about/#about-vetted) companies,
but this sounds like just a conversation with the submitters to check that they
understood the questionnaire properly.

### Case Study
and as a
[case study](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_study).

### Questionnaire
The questionnaire for the Open Data 500 is
[here](http://www.opendata500.com/submitCompany/).
Open Data 500 Team solicited responses to this questionnaire from a
[bunch of people](http://www.opendata500.com/about/#about-identify).

The Open Data 500 Team also identified companies who did not respond to these
solicitations; the Team effectively filled out this questionnaire for companies
who did not respond.

### Further analyses


### Lack of rating
I talked to a member of the Open Data 500 Team for some clarifications.
