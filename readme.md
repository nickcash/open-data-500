The [Open Data 500](http://www.opendata500.com/download/) is
"the first comprehensive study of U.S. companies using open government data to develop new products and services."
You may have read about it in.

[Fedscoop](http://fedscoop.com/open-data-500-intersection-open-data-economy/)
This is [data about open data](/open-data), so I naturally wanted it.

## Data collection methods
As I understand it, the data released on the website are quite close to simple
questionnaire results,
but there are some quirks in this of which you should be aware.

### The population of interest
The Open Data 500 Team is interested in companies that meet their
[eligibility criteria](http://www.opendata500.com/about/#about-eligibility),
which they describe as follows.

1. Be U.S.-based â€“ which can include international companies with a major presence in the U.S.
2. Earn revenue from its products and services. In addition to for-profit companies, nonprofits may qualify if they support themselves primarily through sales of products and services rather than philanthropy.
3. Use open government data as a critical resource for its business. (While most Open Data 500 companies will work with federal data, the study will also include some that use city or state data if their work can scale regionally or nationally)

The Open Data 500 site does not explain how they operationalize these criteria,
but I presume that it works as follows.

1. The questionnaire must indicate that a company has a major presence in the U.S.
2. The answer to "Which of the following are significant sources of revenue for your company?"
  must include something other than "Philanthropy".
3. The answer to "Which of the following are critical sources of data for your company?"
  must include "Federal Open Data", the questionnaire must indicate elsewhere that
  the company is using state or city data from a range of states or cities.

They are [vetting](http://www.opendata500.com/about/#about-vetted) companies,
but this sounds like just a conversation with the submitters to check that they
understood the questionnaire properly.

### Sampling strategy
The questionnaire results can be considered a convenience sample
[convenience sample](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accidental_sampling)
of companies that meet the Open Data 500 eligibility criteria.

The Open Data 500 Team distributed links to the questionnaire in
[these places](http://www.opendata500.com/about/#about-identify).

* Recommendations from government and non-governmental organizations studying this field.
* List of companies using datasets from Data.gov, the federal hub for government data
* Online Open Data Userbase created by Socrata
* Directory of open data companies developed by Deloitte
* Mass email to 3100 people in the GovLab network
* Mass email to 2200 people on contact list for OpenDataNow.com, website of Open Data 500 project director Joel Gurin
* Companies identified in research for upcoming book, Open Data Now
* Response to coverage of the Open Data 500 in Information Week and FedScoop
* Outreach through Twitter
* Outreach at "Data Transparency 2013" conference (September 2013, Washington, DC)
* Blog posts on TheGovLab.org and OpenDataNow.com

They term this sampling strategy "comprehensive call", and I think their use
of comprehensive call is why the Open Data 500 Team considers the Open Data 500
to be a comprehensive study.

### Case study
The Open Data 500 has released data in the
"[download]()" and
"[full list]()" sections.
These data are the straightforward questionnaire results (with one [quirk](#questionnaire))
for the companies that met their eligibility criteria.
Thus, the Open Data 500 is a [case study](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_study)
of companies that meet the Open Data 500 eligibility criteria.

### Questionnaire and non-questionnaire responses
The questionnaire for the Open Data 500 is
[here](http://www.opendata500.com/submitCompany/).
Open Data 500 Team solicited responses to this questionnaire through
[comprehensive call](#sampling strategy), but they also looked for companies
that did not respond to the questionnaire; the Team effectively filled out
parts of this questionnaire for companies who did not respond.

### Further analyses


### Lack of rating
I talked to a member of the Open Data 500 Team for some clarifications.
